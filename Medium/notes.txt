This folder will contain solutions to Medium-level problems.
Starting my consistency again from tomorrow (28/8/25).
1) TwoSum II is a classical Leetcode problem, where we need to find the sum of two characters from the given array and then
    compare that sum with the given target and return 1 based index for each those numbers.
    for eg. We have given an Input Array as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9], and target = 10
    Sum of two characters which makes are equal to Target that are [1, 9]
    now return Index of them i.e final output = [1,6]
